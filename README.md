THe program must be extracted and runs in visual studio community 2022

when running the program you will be given six options
Option 1 allows you to store the recipe's ingredients and cooking steps. When inputting a ingredient please use one of the 4 given units of measurement
This option has been updated to hold multiple recipes and record their contents
Option 2 simply displays what you stored in the first option select it and see what you entered

Option 3 scals all ingredients to one of the 3 given scaling options be it you wish to half, double or triplle all your stored uantity values

Option 4 Allows you to rest the stored quantities after you have scaled them all

Option 5 Clears all the ingredients and cooking instructions should you wish to enter a new recipe
